# ERC20 and Vault Contracts - README

## Overview

This project includes two main components:

1. **ERC20 Token Contract**: A standard ERC20 token implementation.
2. **Vault Contract**: A contract for securely storing ERC20 tokens with additional functionalities.

Both contracts are implemented in Solidity and are designed to be deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.

## ERC20 Token Contract

### Features

- **Standard ERC20 Functions**: `totalSupply`, `balanceOf`, `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, and `allowance`.
- **Minting and Burning**: Functions to mint new tokens and burn existing ones.
- **Events**: Standard ERC20 events such as `Transfer` and `Approval`.

### Deployment

1. Ensure you have a Solidity development environment set up (e.g., Remix, Truffle).
2. Compile the ERC20 token contract.
3. Deploy the contract to your desired Ethereum network.
4. Note the contract address for future reference.

### Example Usage

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./ERC20Token.sol";

contract MyToken is ERC20Token {
    constructor() ERC20Token("MyToken", "MTK", 18, 1000000) {
        // Initial minting or other setup
    }
}
```

## Vault Contract

### Features

- **Deposit and Withdraw**: Functions to deposit ERC20 tokens into the vault and withdraw them.
- **Token Balance Tracking**: Keeps track of each user's deposited token balance.
- **Access Control**: Only authorized addresses can perform certain actions.

### Deployment

1. Ensure you have a Solidity development environment set up.
2. Compile the Vault contract.
3. Deploy the contract to your desired Ethereum network.
4. Note the contract address for future reference.
5. Set the ERC20 token contract address in the Vault contract after deployment.

### Example Usage

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./Vault.sol";

contract MyVault is Vault {
    constructor(address _tokenAddress) Vault(_tokenAddress) {
        // Additional setup if needed
    }
}
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Solidity development environment (e.g., Remix, Truffle, Hardhat)
- Node.js and npm (for Truffle or Hardhat)
- Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) with testnet/mainnet ETH

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/erc20-vault.git
   cd erc20-vault
   ```

2. Install dependencies (if using Truffle or Hardhat):

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Compilation

- Using Truffle:

  ```bash
  truffle compile
  ```

- Using Hardhat:

  ```bash
  npx hardhat compile
  ```

### Deployment

- Using Truffle:

  ```bash
  truffle migrate --network <network-name>
  ```

- Using Hardhat:

  ```bash
  npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>
  ```

## Interacting with Contracts

### ERC20 Token Contract

- **Mint Tokens**: Only callable by the owner.
- **Burn Tokens**: Callable by any user with a sufficient balance.
- **Transfer Tokens**: Transfer tokens to another address.

### Vault Contract

- **Deposit Tokens**: Deposit a specified amount of ERC20 tokens.
- **Withdraw Tokens**: Withdraw a specified amount of ERC20 tokens.

### Example Interactions

#### Minting Tokens (ERC20)

```solidity
await erc20Token.mint("0xYourAddress", 1000);
```

#### Depositing Tokens (Vault)

```solidity
await erc20Token.approve(vaultAddress, 500);
await vault.deposit(500);
```

#### Withdrawing Tokens (Vault)

```solidity
await vault.withdraw(200);
```

## Security Considerations

- **Access Control**: Ensure that only authorized addresses can mint and burn tokens.
- **Testing**: Thoroughly test the contracts on a testnet before deploying to mainnet.
- **Audits**: Consider getting the contracts audited by a third-party security firm.
